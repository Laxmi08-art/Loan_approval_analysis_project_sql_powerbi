## 🧪 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Excel** (for basic EDA and formatting)
- **SQL** for querying structured data,Extraction
- **Power BI**  visualization

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Initial inspection, shape, and summary of the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized inconsistent data
   - Converted categorical variables

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized the relationships between features and loan status
   - Identified important predictors like Credit History, Applicant Income, and Property Area

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Applicants with a good credit history had over **80% approval rate**
   - Income alone doesn't determine approval — loan amount, coapplicant income, and credit history are key factors
   - Potential to reduce loan default risk by **15–25%** with data-driven filtering

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Credit History** is the most influential feature in loan approval.
- **Married & Graduate** applicants from **urban areas** with **stable income** have a higher chance of approval.
- Risk can be minimized by filtering out high loan amounts without matching income support or credit records.

## ✅ Project Outcome

- Cleaned and analyzed 600+ loan records
- Created a visually insightful EDA report
- Suggested actionable rules for minimizing default risk
